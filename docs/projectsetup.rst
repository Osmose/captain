Setting up a new project
========================

FIXME - instructions for setting up a new project in Captain Shove for shoving.

1. what files do you need to add to the project repository?
2. how do you add the project to Captain?
3. how do you give users access to deploy the project?
4. how do you set up shove?
5. how do you test a deployment to verify it's set up correctly?
6. how do you revoke user access?

are there other things to cover?
